    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Potatoes</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. (A French Fry Cutter makes this easier.)</li>
      <li>Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight. (Longer = crispier fries)</li>
      <li>Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Don’t overcrowd them by placing too many
        in at a time, they won’t be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup!
